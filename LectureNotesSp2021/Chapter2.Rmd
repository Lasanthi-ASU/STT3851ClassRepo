# Statistical learning?

Statistical learning is the use of past data to find how a variable depends on other variables, or how data can be summarized or represented. 

For example, an insurance company may want to estimate the claim costs (_________) for an insured
based on various features (_________) of the insured-age, sex, income, credit rating, past claim experience, and other similar features. If ____ is claim costs and ____ are the various features, we would like to find the function ___ for which


&nbsp;

There is no perfect $f$, so we have to allow for error. Let ____ the error. Then we want a function $f$ for which

&nbsp; 
  
Where, 
  * $\epsilon$ is independent of $X$
  
  * $E(\epsilon) = 0$ 
  
We would like to pick the $f$ that makes the error $\epsilon$ as small as possible. The remaining error is the ________ error.

  * The input variables $X_i$ are called ________ variables, ________ variables, ________, or ________. (Usually, the term "features" is only used if $X_i$ is a discrete random variable with a finite number of possible values.) 

  * The output variable $Y$ is called the ________ variable or the ________.
  
  * Sample size is usually denoted by $n$
  
  * The number of predictors is denoted by ____
  

```{example}
Example:
  Suppose that we are statistical consultants hired by a client to provide advice on 
how to improve sales of a particular product. The Advertising data set consists of 
the sales of that product in 200 different markets, along with advertising budgets 
for the product in each of those markets for three different media: TV, radio, and 
newspaper.

  1) What is the response variable in this senario?
  
  2) What is the sample size?
  
  3) How many predictor variables are there? (what is $p$?)

  4) List the predictor variables
```

It is not possible for our client to directly increase
sales of the product. On the other hand, they can control the advertising
expenditure in each of the three media. Therefore, if we determine that
there is an association between advertising and sales, then we can instruct
our client to adjust advertising budgets, thereby indirectly increasing sales.
In other words, our goal is to develop an accurate model that can be used
to predict sales on the basis of the three media budgets.

## Why estimate $f$?

There are two main reasons that we may wish to estimate f: 

  1) 
  
  2) 
  

### Prediction

In many situations, a set of inputs ___ are readily available, but the output
___ cannot be easily obtained. In this setting, since the error term averages
to zero, we can predict $Y$ using 

&nbsp; 

where ___ represents our estimate for ___, and ___ represents the resulting prediction
for ___.

The accuracy of $\hat{Y}$ as a prediction for $Y$ depends on two quantities

  1) 
  
&nbsp; 

  2) 
  
&nbsp; 


**Let's look at this mathematically**

$$E(Y-\hat{Y})^2 = E[f(X) + \epsilon - \hat{f}(X)]^2$$
&nbsp; 

The focus of this class is on techniques for estimating $f$ with the aim of
minimizing the reducible error.

### Inference

Here we want to understand
the relationship between $X$ and $Y$ , or more specifically, to understand how
$Y$ changes as a function of $X_1, . . .,X_p.$

In this case, we are
interested in answering the following questions:

  1) 
  &nbsp;
  
  2) 
  &nbsp;
  
  3)
  &nbsp;
  
```{example}
Example:
  
Consider a company that is interested in conducting a
direct-marketing campaign. The goal is to identify individuals who will
respond positively to a mailing, based on observations of demographic variables
measured on each individual. In this case, the demographic variables
serve as predictors, and response to the marketing campaign (either positive
or negative) serves as the outcome. 

  a) Is this a prediction problem or an inference problem?
  
  b) Explain why.
```

<!--
This is an example of modeling for prediction.

The company is not interested in obtaining a deep understanding of the relationships between each individual predictor and the response; instead, the company simply wants an accurate model to predict the response using the predictors. 
-->

```{example}
Example:
  
Now consider the above company is interested in answering questions such as:
– Which media contribute to sales?
– Which media generate the biggest boost in sales? or
– How much increase in sales is associated with a given increase in TV
advertising?
  
  a) Is this a prediction problem or an inference problem?
  
  b) Explain why.
  
```

```{example}
Example:
  
Consider modeling the brand of a product that a customer might purchase based on
variables such as price, store location, discount levels, competition price,
and so forth. In this situation one might really be most interested in how
each of the individual variables affects the probability of purchase. For
instance, what effect will changing the price of a product have on sales? 
  
  a) Is this a prediction problem or an inference problem?
